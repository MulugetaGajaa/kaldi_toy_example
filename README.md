# kaldi_toy_example by Pedro Fonseca Esteves
Toy example to illustrate how to use kaldi recipes.

This tutorial is a very hands-on pratical introduction to kaldi (a modern toolkit used for ASR and other Speech Processing tasks). The only pre-requisites are having kaldi installed. 

It justs slightly deviates from the kaldi for dummies tutorial (https://kaldi-asr.org/doc/kaldi_for_dummies.html) adding few extras like getting the best transcriptions generated by the ASR system.

Directories:

- untouched : This directory contains 2 folders, **train** and **test** which have .m4a files recorded by me on my cellphone saying sequences of animal names in portuguese ( cão - dog , sapo - frog , gato - cat and leão - lion). IMPORTANTE NOTE - This recordings are .m4a and have 48kHz sample rate, in order to follow kaldi for dummies one must convert them to wav and downsample them to 16kHz.

Command to convert a directory of files to wav: 
```
for f in *.m4a; do ffmpeg  -i "$f" "${f/%m4a/wav}"; done
```

Command to downsample(There is a need to create a tmp directory for the downsampling cause the same filename cannot be used as input and output file, otherwise an error will happen: 
```
mkdir tmp; for file in *.wav; do sox ${file} -r 16000 ./tmp/${file}; done 
```
