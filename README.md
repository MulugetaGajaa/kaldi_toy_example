# kaldi_toy_example by Pedro Fonseca Esteves
Toy example to illustrate how to use kaldi recipes.

This tutorial is a very hands-on pratical introduction to kaldi (a modern toolkit used for ASR and other Speech Processing tasks) . 

It justs slightly deviates from the kaldi for dummies tutorial (https://kaldi-asr.org/doc/kaldi_for_dummies.html) adding few extras like getting the best transcriptions generated by the ASR system.
