analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 64.2857142857% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (48,52.6,75) frames.

Overall, k_B accounts for 2.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,14.4,17) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 24.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
