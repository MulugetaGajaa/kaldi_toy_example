At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (56,71.2,81) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,20.4,31) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 83.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,23.1,54) frames.
Overall, 6~w~_E accounts for 21.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (42,43.6,54) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,42.8,81) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 16.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,17.5,27) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,9.3,18) frames.
Overall, u_E accounts for 9.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,27.0,37) frames.
Overall, g_B accounts for 6.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,4.8,5) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 6.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,22.8,23) frames.
Overall, l_B accounts for 4.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,8.7,11) frames.
Overall, j_I accounts for 4.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,9.7,9) frames.
Overall, s_B accounts for 3.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,23.0,22) frames.
Overall, p_I accounts for 3.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,19.5,19) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 27.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 73.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 1.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,13.0,13)
