At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (57,75.2,84) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,20.6,31) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 83.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,22.0,54) frames.
Overall, 6~w~_E accounts for 22.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (42,41.1,57) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 17.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,18.0,28) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 16.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,44.3,84) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 8.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,8.2,11) frames.
Overall, u_E accounts for 8.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,26.0,38) frames.
Overall, g_B accounts for 5.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,5.5,5) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 5.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,23.0,23) frames.
Overall, l_B accounts for 4.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,8.3,10) frames.
Overall, j_I accounts for 4.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,10.3,10) frames.
Overall, s_B accounts for 2.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,4.0,3) frames.
Overall, p_I accounts for 2.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,19.5,19) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 28.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (8,8.0,8)
